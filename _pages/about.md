I am a final-year Computer Science undergrad at the <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/">University of Calgary</a> passionate about AI's potential to change the world. Specifically, I am interested in the design of robust mechanisms that can ensure that the changes enacted by increasingly advanced AI systems are aligned with what we broadly call "human values".

I have had the privilege to be mentored by many amazing professors throughout my research journey, which began in high school when I joined <a href="https://lindsayvirtualhuman.com/">Dr. Christian Jacob's</a> lab and developed VR teaching tools for cell biology. I later started working in <a href="https://ucalgary.ca/labs/miplab">Dr. Nils Forkert's</a> lab, where I evaluated the causal reasoning capabilities and biases of machine learning models and co-authored several conference papers. My Honours thesis research with <a href="https://tylerbonnell.weebly.com/">Dr. Tyler Bonnell</a> explored using dynamic, naturalistic environments to address catastrophic forgetting in reinforcement learning agents.


<!-- and I am particularly interested in how the implementation of causal mechanisms can help with this, and how multi-agent frameworks might serve as testbeds for their interactions with the world. -->


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
