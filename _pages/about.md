I am a final-year Computer Science undergrad at the University of Calgary. I have had the great privilege to work with many professors throughout my degree. I first began working in Dr. Christian Jacob's Virtual Human LINDSAY Lab in high school, and continued working with Unreal Engine and Blender for three summers to create immersive VR teaching tools for cell biology. I spent the next three summers in Dr. Nils Forkert's Medical Image Processing and Machine Learning Laboratory, developing causal computer vision models and contributing to three publications, with a fourth, first-author paper currently under review for AAMAS 2026. I conducted my Honours thesis research with Dr. Tyler Bonnell, working towards more naturalistic environments for continual learning in RL.

I have long believed in the potential for AI to improve the world, but the current pace of progress creates dangerous incentives to rush the deployment of AGI for maximum strategic benefit. This speed and recklessness increases the chances of catastrophic outcomes, so I believe it is imperative that we prioritize the design of robust mechanisms that ensure that AGI, if developed, will be aligned with our best interests. Therefore, my current research interests are in the field of AI alignment, as well as overlapping fields like interpretability and explainability, and I am particularly interested in how the implementation of causal mechanisms can help with this, and how multi-agent frameworks might serve as testbeds for their interactions with the world.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
